# WebDriverExamples
A place where I can put quick tests or sample code for MSEdgeDriver and MicrosoftWebDriver

I strongly recommend you use Selenium 4. To do so, make sure you python and pip installed.
Then run 
`pip install selenium==4.0.0.a7`

You also need to make sure to have a matching version of MSEdgeDriver and MSEdge.exe

I'm going to add scripts to do that automatically later.
